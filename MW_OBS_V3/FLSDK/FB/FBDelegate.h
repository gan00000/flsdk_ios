  睡眠视为忙碌的一天后要做的最后一件事，为了完成家务、作业、工作或追新剧，晚点再睡也没事。

That thinking needs to be changed, Grander said.

格兰德纳说，这种想法必须改变。

"Don't see your sleep as the amount of time you have left in your day," he advised. "See your sleep as the amount of time you need in order to set yourself up for a productive tomorrow."

他建议：“不要将睡眠时间看成你
